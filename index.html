    <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m Rick Balderas!</h1>

    <p class="username">Welcome to my personal website. I am a recent computer science graduate (Spring 2025) from the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley.
     Along the way, I gained hands-on experience in software development, data analysis, UX/UI design, and network systems/protocols. However, lately I have taken an
     interest in web development, a field I did not get the opportunity to study during my undergraduate years. This website represents my first step into that journey.
